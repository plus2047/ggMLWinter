Google ML Winter Camp 2020, Yang Hu, Jiahao Xu, Xiaohan Yu ~

All code used for our final demo is here.

`FontRNN` is the code for preprocessing and training. It's based on [FontRNN](https://github.com/ShusenTang/FontRNN).

We use [CASIA Online dataset](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/handwriting/Home.html).

`FontRNN/code/preprocess.ipynb` are used to preprocess this dataset.

Then `FontRNN/code/draw_all_char.ipynb` is used to draw all chars generated by our model (3700+ chinese chars).

We upload all those chars and our models into github, so **it may takes some minutes to clone thos repo.**

The UI is a flask project. it's very sample, just go to `web` folder and run `flask run` to lauch it.
